        <p class="movieDetail">
          Asta and Yuno were abandoned together at the same church and have been
          inseparable since. As children, they promised that they would compete
          against each other to see who would become the next Wizard King.
          However, as they grew up the differences in their abilities became
          considerably noticeable. Yuno was a genius in his magic control and
          power, whilst Asta possessed no magic at all so he trained his
          physical body as much as possible in an attempt to make up for his
          lack of magic. Having received their Grimoires at age 15, Yuno
          unexpectedly got one with a four leaf clover symbol on his whilst Asta
          unfortunately did not even get a Grimoire at all. However, when Yuno
          was threatened, the truth about Asta's power was revealed, he received
          a five leaf clover Grimoire, a "black clover". Now the two friends are
          heading out in the world, both seeking the same goal.
